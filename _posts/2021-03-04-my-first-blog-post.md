well I guess this is blog one. Thought I'd mention how cool github is, but it's also pretty confusing :/ 
I've coded in python (education, yay) and then realised... it isn't as useful as I thought. So now I'm branching out, github first.
Anyone know how to scroll faster through letters using arrow keys? Or is it easier to cick...
I really hope I don't give this up, it's gotta be pretty cool when with friends or in a workplace, right? Ah well, time will tell.
Post one. See you when I learn new skills :)
